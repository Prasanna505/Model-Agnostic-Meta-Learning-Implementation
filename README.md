# Model-Agnostic-Meta-Learning-Implementation

This is the implementation of optimisation-based meta-learning i.e MAML technique. 
Here we implemented MAML algorithm on IHDS dataset(Indian Heritage digital Space) which consists of images of heritage sites.
Few-shot learning is instantiation of Meta-Learning which trains using only few images of each task
